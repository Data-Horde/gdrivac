Luckily, if you access a shared link before that date, your Google account will be able to continue accessing it after the deadline. Google-Drivac is a tool to associate a Google account with a list of Google Drive links.

Install requirements with:
```bash
$pip -r install requirements.txt
```
Help:
```bash
$python gdrivac.py -h
```
